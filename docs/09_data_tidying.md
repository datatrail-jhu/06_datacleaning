# Data Tidying

Throughout this course set, we'll have a number of projects for you to complete. These will be included as Exercises. This means they will *not* be required to pass the course and receive your certificate; however, completing them will *really* help to improve your understanding of the material covered and to ensure that you've begun to master the skills needed to be a data scientist.

In each project, we'll aim to get you started and to ask questions that will help guide you through the project. But, we'll intentionally leave pieces out where you have to figure out what needs to be done.

This first project will require you to:

* use version control
* demonstrate the skills you've learned programming in R
* wrangle data

You can access the first project by going to the exercise accompanying this lesson.
